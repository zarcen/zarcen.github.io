        So strange an accident has happened to us that I cannot forbear
        recording it, although it is very probable that you will see me before
        these papers can come into your possession.
        Last Monday (July 31st) we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed
        in the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea-room in which
        she floated.  Our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we
        were compassed round by a very thick fog.  We accordingly lay to,
        hoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather.
        About two o'clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out
        in every direction, vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to
        have no end.  Some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to
        grow watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly
        attracted our attention and diverted our solicitude from our own
        situation.  We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by
        dogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance of half a mile; a
        being which had the shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature,
        sat in the sledge and guided the dogs.  We watched the rapid progress
        of the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the
        distant inequalities of the ice.  This appearance excited our
        unqualified wonder.  We were, as we believed, many hundred miles from
        any land; but this apparition seemed to denote that it was not, in
        reality, so distant as we had supposed.  Shut in, however, by ice, it
        was impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with the
        greatest attention.  About two hours after this occurrence we heard the
        ground sea, and before night the ice broke and freed our ship.  We,
        however, lay to until the morning, fearing to encounter in the dark
        those large loose masses which float about after the breaking up of the
        ice.  I profited of this time to rest for a few hours.
        In the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck and
        found all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently
        talking to someone in the sea.  It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we
        had seen before, which had drifted towards us in the night on a large
        fragment of ice.  Only one dog remained alive; but there was a human
        being within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel.
        He was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of
        some undiscovered island, but a European.  When I appeared on deck the
        master said, "Here is our captain, and he will not allow you to perish
        on the open sea."
        On perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a
        foreign accent.  "Before I come on board your vessel," said he, "will
        you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound?"
        You may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed
        to me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom I should have
        supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not
        have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford.  I
        replied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the
        northern pole.
