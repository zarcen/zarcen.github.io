        I am by birth a Genevese, and my family is one of the most distinguished of that republic. 
        My ancestors had been for many years counsellors and syndics, and my father had filled several public 
        situations with honour and reputation.  
        He was respected by all who knew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public business.
        He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the affairs of his country; 
        a variety of circumstances had prevented his  marrying early, 
        nor was it until the decline of life that he became a husband and the father of a family. 
        As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot refrain from relating them. 
        One of his most intimate friends was a merchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, 
        through numerous mischances, into poverty. 
        This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a proud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty 
        and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been distinguished for his rank and magnificence. 
        Having paid his debts, therefore, in the most honourable manner, 
        he retreated with his daughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in wretchedness. 
        My father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship and was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances.
        He bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct so little worthy of the affection that united them. 
        He lost no time in endeavouring to seek him out, 
        with the hope of persuading him to begin the world again through his credit and assistance. 
        Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself, 
        and it was ten  months before my father discovered his abode. 
        Overjoyed at this discovery, he hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street near the Reuss. 
        But when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed him. 
        Beaufort had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes, 
        but it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months, 
        and in the meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a merchant's house. 
        The interval was, consequently, spent in inaction; his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had 
        leisure for reflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his mind  that at the end of three months 
        he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion. 
        His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness, but she saw with despair that their 
        little fund was rapidly decreasing and that there was no other prospect of support. 
        But Caroline Beaufort possessed a mind of an uncommon mould, and her courage rose to support her in her adversity.
        She procured plain work; she plaited straw and by various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient 
        to support life. Several months passed in this manner. Her father grew worse; 
        her time was more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence decreased; 
        and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving her an orphan and a beggar. 
        This last blow overcame her, and she knelt by Beaufort's coffin weeping bitterly, 
        when my father entered the chamber. 
        He came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, who committed herself to his care.
